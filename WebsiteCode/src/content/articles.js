    title: "What is Stress, Really?",
    icon: "🧠",
    summary: "Understanding the science behind your body's stress response.",
    content: `
      <p>Stress is your body's natural response to challenges or demands. When you perceive a threat—whether physical or psychological—your nervous system releases a flood of stress hormones, including adrenaline and cortisol.</p>
      
      <h4>The Fight-or-Flight Response</h4>
      <p>This ancient survival mechanism prepares your body to either confront danger or escape it. Your heart rate increases, muscles tense, breathing quickens, and senses sharpen. While this response was essential for our ancestors facing predators, today it's often triggered by work deadlines, traffic, or social pressures.</p>
      
      <h4>Acute vs. Chronic Stress</h4>
      <p><strong>Acute stress</strong> is short-term and can actually be beneficial—it helps you meet challenges and can improve performance. However, <strong>chronic stress</strong>, when your body stays in high alert for extended periods, can lead to serious health problems including heart disease, anxiety, depression, and weakened immune function.</p>
      
      <h4>The Good News</h4>
      <p>Your body is incredibly adaptable. With the right techniques—like the breathing exercises in this app—you can activate your parasympathetic nervous system, which counteracts the stress response and brings your body back to a calm, balanced state.</p>

    title: "Understanding Your Stress Score",
    icon: "📊",
    summary: "How StressView measures and interprets your stress levels.",
    content: `
      <p>Your StressView device uses multiple physiological signals to calculate your stress score, giving you objective insight into your body's state.</p>
      
      <h4>Heart Rate Variability (HRV)</h4>
      <p>HRV measures the variation in time between heartbeats. Higher variability typically indicates a relaxed, adaptable state, while lower variability often signals stress. Your device tracks these subtle changes beat-by-beat.</p>
      
      <h4>Galvanic Skin Response (GSR)</h4>
      <p>When you're stressed, your sweat glands become more active, changing your skin's electrical conductivity. The GSR sensor detects these microscopic changes, providing another window into your autonomic nervous system.</p>
      
      <h4>Stress Zones Explained</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>0-25% (Calm):</strong> Your body is in a relaxed, parasympathetic state. This is ideal for recovery and creative thinking.</li>
        <li><strong>26-50% (Balanced):</strong> A healthy middle ground with good alertness and focus.</li>
        <li><strong>51-70% (Elevated):</strong> Your stress response is activated. Good for short bursts of productivity, but not sustainable.</li>
        <li><strong>71-100% (High):</strong> Your body is in full fight-or-flight mode. Use breathing exercises to bring this down.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>What Affects Your Score?</h4>
      <p>Physical activity, caffeine, sleep quality, hydration, and emotional state all influence your readings. Track patterns over time to understand your personal triggers.</p>

    title: "The Power of Breathing",
    icon: "🌬️",
    summary: "Why controlled breathing is the fastest way to reduce stress.",
    content: `
      <p>Breathing is unique among bodily functions—it happens automatically, but you can also control it consciously. This gives you direct access to your autonomic nervous system.</p>
      
      <h4>The Vagus Nerve Connection</h4>
      <p>When you exhale slowly, you stimulate the vagus nerve, which activates your parasympathetic "rest and digest" system. This is why longer exhales are featured in calming breathing techniques.</p>
      
      <h4>Techniques in This App</h4>
      
      <p><strong>4-7-8 Breathing (Calm)</strong><br>
      Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7, exhale for 8. The extended exhale maximizes vagal stimulation. Excellent for anxiety and sleep.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Box Breathing (Focus)</strong><br>
      Equal 4-second phases: inhale, hold, exhale, hold. Used by Navy SEALs for maintaining calm under pressure. Great for concentration.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Quick Reset</strong><br>
      Deep inhale followed by an extended double exhale. Designed for rapid stress relief when you only have a minute.</p>
      
      <h4>The Science</h4>
      <p>Studies show that just 5 minutes of controlled breathing can significantly reduce cortisol levels and increase HRV. Regular practice can actually rewire your nervous system to be more resilient to stress over time.</p>

    title: "Quick Stress Relievers",
    icon: "⚡",
    summary: "Simple techniques you can use anywhere, anytime.",
    content: `
      <p>When stress hits suddenly, you need quick, effective tools. Here are proven techniques that work in under 2 minutes.</p>
      
      <h4>The Physiological Sigh</h4>
      <p>Take a deep breath in, then add a second quick inhale to fully expand your lungs. Follow with a long, slow exhale. This is the fastest known way to calm your nervous system—your body naturally does this when crying or after intense exercise.</p>
      
      <h4>5-4-3-2-1 Grounding</h4>
      <p>Engage your senses: Name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, and 1 you taste. This pulls your attention away from anxious thoughts and into the present moment.</p>
      
      <h4>Cold Water Technique</h4>
      <p>Splash cold water on your face or hold something cold. This triggers the "dive reflex," which slows your heart rate and redirects blood to vital organs—an instant calm response.</p>
      
      <h4>Progressive Muscle Release</h4>
      <p>Tense your shoulders up to your ears for 5 seconds, then release completely. Repeat with your fists, jaw, or any area holding tension. The release creates immediate relaxation.</p>
      
      <h4>Movement Break</h4>
      <p>Stand up, stretch your arms overhead, and shake out your hands for 30 seconds. Physical movement helps discharge the stress hormones your body has released.</p>

    title: "Building Stress Resilience",
    icon: "💪",
    summary: "Long-term strategies for a calmer, more balanced life.",
    content: `
      <p>While quick techniques are valuable, building lasting resilience requires consistent habits. Here's how to become naturally more stress-resistant.</p>
      
      <h4>Daily Practice</h4>
      <p>Just 5-10 minutes of breathing exercises daily can significantly improve your baseline HRV and stress response. Morning practice sets a calm tone for the day; evening practice improves sleep quality.</p>
      
      <h4>Sleep Optimization</h4>
      <p>Poor sleep dramatically increases stress sensitivity. Aim for 7-9 hours, keep a consistent schedule, and use the 4-7-8 breathing technique if you have trouble falling asleep.</p>
      
      <h4>Movement</h4>
      <p>Regular exercise is one of the most powerful stress-reduction tools available. Even a 20-minute walk improves HRV and reduces cortisol. Find movement you enjoy and make it non-negotiable.</p>
      
      <h4>Mindful Awareness</h4>
      <p>Use your StressView device to build awareness of your patterns. Which situations trigger stress? What times of day are hardest? This knowledge helps you prepare and intervene early.</p>
      
      <h4>Social Connection</h4>
      <p>Positive social interaction releases oxytocin, which counteracts stress hormones. Prioritize meaningful connections, even brief ones.</p>
      
      <h4>The Compound Effect</h4>
      <p>Small, consistent actions compound over time. A few minutes of breathing practice today might not feel transformative, but after weeks and months, you'll notice a fundamentally calmer baseline state.</p>
